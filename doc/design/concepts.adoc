== Concepts

This library has two fundamental concepts:

 - <<awaitable,awaitable>>
 - coroutine

An <<awaitable, awaitable>> is an expression that can be used with `co_await`
from within a coroutine, e.g.:

[source,cpp]
----
co_await delay(50ms);
----

An *actual awaitable* is a type that can be `co_await`-ed from within any coroutine,
like a `delay` operation.
A `pseudo-awaitable` is one that can only be used in coroutines adding special
functionality for it. It is akin to a contextual pseudo-keyword.

All the verbs in the <<this_coro, this_coro>> namespace are such pseudo-awaitables.

[source,cpp]
----
auto exec = co_await this_coro::executor;
----

NOTE: This library exposes a set of `enable_*` base classes for promises,
to make the creation of custom coroutines easy.


A coroutine in the context of this documentation refers
to an asynchronous coroutine, i.e. synchronous coroutines like
link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/coroutine/generator[std::generator]
are not considered.

All coroutines except  <<main, main>> are also actual awaitables.
